# Intro to Artela

Artela is an extensible blockchain network enabling developers to build feature-rich dApps.

<!-- Artela is an extensible blockchain network enabling developers to build feature-rich dApps.  -->

Artela is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of dApp functionality beyond smart contracts, unlocking the full potential of Web3 innovations.

## What Artela is building:

**Artela Blockchain**
    
Artela Blockchain is a layer 1 network that empowers developers to add user-defined native extensions and build feature-rich dApps. It offers extensibility that goes beyond EVM-equivalence, inter-domain interoperability, and boundless scalability with its elastic block space design.
  

**Aspect Programming**
    
Aspect Programming is a universal programming framework that supports the dynamic creation of native extension modules for blockchain at runtime. It offers a universal stack for all chains to build extension modules to enhance dApp functionality, providing a versatile framework for expanding functionality.
<!-- **Artela’s extensibility empowers developers to achieve maximum customization by creating modular extensions on top of the public base layer. Meanwhile, the network’s elastic block space ensures optimal scalability and performance for the dApp.**

**Artela's technical goals include:**

1. **Base Layer Extensibility:** Allow developers to build chain-native modular public/private service on top of the public base layer. 
2. **EVM-native & Multi-VMs compatible:** Natively provide EVM as the base layer execution environment for lightweight smart contract dApps. Additionally, builders have the flexibility to choose from a range of VMs: CosmWasm, ZKWASM, GnoVM… instead of EVM on customized extensions.  
3. **Customizable Public Service**: Allow developers to build components utilized as plug-and-play public services, or extend existing public services. Enhance dApp customization and significantly reduce the barrier to entry.
4. **Scalable Heterogeneous Computing:** Provide decentralized consensus engine compatible for heterogeneous tech-stack.
5. **Elastic Scalability Execution Engine:** Enable elastic scaling of validator nodes. Provide isolated block space for dApps with high performance requirements.
