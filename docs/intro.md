# What is Artela?
> Artela is an extensible blockchain network enabling developers to build feature-rich dApps.

The emergence of Smart Contracts has made it possible for developers to implement custom logic on blockchain networks, taking the first step towards the ‘extensibility’ of blockchain applications. However, the customization capability of dApps is limited due to the low flexibility granted to developers. Specific virtual machines (VMs) are optimized for certain use cases. Developers have to make compromises on the choice of VM and application design. Among other things, they are limited to a few design patterns and system-level utilizations.

To improve the blockchain network extensibility, many have adopted the solution of application-specific chain. Provide developers with isolated block space, independent sovereignty, and reduced throughput competition, among other benefits. However, as a trade-off, intra-chain benefits such as shared security, staked asset liquidity must be abandoned, leading to the fragmentation within the app-chain ecosystem. Moreover, building and maintaining application chains comes with a high barrier to entry. For applications built on both the smart contract chain and app-chain (e.g. dYdX built both on Ethereum and Cosmos), a ‘multi-chain’ strategy is unavoidable. Because the isolation of smart contract chain and app-chain makes ‘inter-chain’ of the single app impossible.

Artela is building an extensible network where builders can build modules and extend modular public/private services to achieve chain-native customization in one public blockchain network. Bridge the gap between limited smart contract dApps and heavy, fragmented app-specific chains. Provide dApps with chain-native composability and system-level customization.

Artela’s extensibility empowers developers to achieve maximum customization by creating modular extensions on top of the public base layer. Meanwhile, the network’s elastic block space ensures optimal scalability and performance for the dApp.

**Artela's technical goals include:**
* Base Layer Extensibility: Allow developers to build chain-native modular public/private service on top of the public base layer. 
* EVM-native & Multi-VMs compatible: Natively provide EVM as the base layer execution environment for lightweight smart contract dApps. Additionally, builders have the flexibility to choose from a range of VMs: CosmWasm, ZKWASM, GnoVM… instead of EVM on customized extensions.  
* Customizable Public Service: Allow developers to build components utilized as plug-and-play public services, or extend existing public services. Enhance dApp customization and significantly reduce the barrier to entry.
* Scalable Heterogeneous Computing: Provide decentralized consensus engine compatible for heterogeneous tech-stack.
* Elastic Scalability Execution Engine: Enable elastic scaling of validator nodes. Provide isolated block space for dApps with high performance requirements.
