Artela is a Layer 1 network that empowers developers to add user-defined native extensions and build feature-rich dApps. 

Artela goes beyond EVM equivalence and enables full EVM interoperability with a WASM runtime. You can build smart contracts in EVM as usual and construct Aspects as native extensions in WASM VM to create a feature-rich modular dApp.
