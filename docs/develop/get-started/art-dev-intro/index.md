# Introduction to Artela Development

This guide will demonstrate the creation of a distributed application (DApp) with aspect-oriented functionality, specifically designed to intercept and identify specific transactions during their processing, all while allowing the injection of additional business logic. As an illustrative example, when a transaction is detected attempting to modify the value of a state variable (e.g., 'Count') and that value meets certain specific conditions, such as being an even number, the current transaction will be reverted.
The additional knowledge required for this guide includes:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [asloc](https://docs.artela.network/develop/asolc-guide)


# Setting up a new project
Make sure that a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and its package manager npm (that comes with Node.js) are installed,
Start by installing the `aspect-tool`:

```bash
npm install -g @artela/aspect-tool
```


## Project Initialization

To kick off your project with `aspect-tool`, follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a new directory and navigate into it
mkdir my-first-aspect && cd my-first-aspect

# Set up the npm project with aspect-tool 
aspect-tool init

# Install the necessary dependencies
npm install
```

This will create a project directory with the following structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ asconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ assembly
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aspect                 <-- Your aspect code resides here
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ aspect.ts          <-- Entry functions for the aspect
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts                  <-- Place your smart contracts here
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts                    <-- Utilitity scripts, including deploying, binding and etc.

```


## Add and compile your smart contract(s)

### 1. Add a Smart Contract

Within the `contracts` directory of your project, create your smart contract source files with a `.sol` extension.

For demonstration, we'll create a `Counter.sol` file and implement a simple `Counter` smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;

contract Counter {
    uint256 private _counter;
    address private owner;
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    function isOwner(address user) external view returns (bool result) {
        return user == owner;
    }
    function add(uint256 number) public {
        _counter = _counter + number;
    }
    function get() external view returns (uint256 result)  {
        return _counter;
    }
}
```

This smart contract introduces a `add` function that increments an on-chain `counter` variable. We'll later integrate this smart contract with our Aspect.

### 2. Compile the Smart Contract

Compile your contract using:

```bash
npm run contract:build 
```

Successful compilation will generate `Counter.abi` and `Counter.bin` files in the `build/contract` directory.

### 3. Deploy the Smart Contract

Update the `project.config.json` in the root directory with the appropriate network configuration:
more development environment setup, please refer to [artela devnet](https://docs.artela.network/develop/start-a-local-node)
```json
{
  "node": "https://testnet-rpc1.artela.network"
}
```
Create a blockchain account (optional). '-priKeyPath' if not set up, it is stored in './privateKey.txt' path by default.
```bash
npm run account:create --pkfile ./build/privateKey.txt
```

Then, deploy your contract with the provided script:

```bash
npm run contract:deploy -- --pkfile {privateKey-path} \                        
                           --abi ./build/contract/Counter.abi \                          
                           --bytecode ./build/contract/Counter.bin \                          
                           --gas 200000 
```

Upon successful deployment, the terminal will display the contract address.

:::note
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: If your contract's constructor requires input parameters, use the `--args` argument in a JSON array format, like `--args '[1, "a"]'`.

## Add and compile your Aspect

### 1. Implement an Aspect

You'll find the Aspect source files in `assembly/aspect/aspect.ts`.

For example, to add logic after a smart contract call execution, open `aspect.ts`, locate the `postTxExecute` function, and insert your logic:

```typescript
 postContractCall(ctx: PostContractCallCtx): void {
    // Insert your logic here
}
```

:::note
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: For detailed instructions, refer to the [Aspect Doc](https://docs.artela.network/develop/aspect-tools/aspect-docs).
:::

### 2. Access State Changes of Smart Contract in Aspect

To integrate the state trace of `Counter` contract with our Aspect, ensuring only even numbers are processed, follow these steps:

1. Generate the required state tracing code:

```bash
npm run aspect:gen
```

2. This will produce a `counter-storage.ts` file in `assembly/aspect`. Use this file in your Aspect to check the state of the `Counter` contract:

```typescript
    // Import the generated state tracer
    import { CounterState } from './counter-storage';
    import {  sys } from '@artela/aspect-libs';

    postContractCall(ctx: PostContractCallCtx): void {
        const counter = new CounterState.counter(ctx.trace, ctx.tx.content.unwrap().to);
        const lastCount = counter.current();

        // Revert the transaction if the 'counter' value is odd
        if (lastCount && lastCount.modInt(2) !== 0) {
            sys.revert("The count value is not even!");
        }
    }
```

:::note
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: For an in-depth understanding, refer to the [Aspect Doc](https://docs.artela.network/develop/aspect-tools/aspect-docs).

### 3. Compile the Aspect

Build your Aspect:

```bash
npm run aspect:build 
```

The resulting `release.wasm` in the `build` folder contains the necessary WASM bytecode.

### 4. Deploy the Aspect

Deploy your compiled Aspect:

```bash

npm run aspect:deploy -- --pkPath {privateKey-path}                          
                         --gasPrice 100000000                          
                         --gas 200000                          
                         --wasm ./build/release.wasm
```

### 5. Bind the Smart Contract and Aspect

Deploying the Aspect doesn't automatically activate it. To make it functional, bind it to a smart contract:

```bash
npm run contract:bind -- --pkPath {privateKey-path}                         
                         --contract {smart-contract-address} 
                         --abi ./build/contract/Counter.abi                         
                         --aspectId {aspect-Id}                          
                         --gas 200000 
```

### 6. Test the Smart Contract and Aspect Integration

Now that the `Counter` contract and Aspect are bound, test the setup:

```bash
npm run contract:call -- --contract {smart-contract-address}                          
                         --abi ./build/contract/Counter.abi                          
                         --senderPK {privateKey-path}                          
                         --method count                          
                         --args '[55]'                          
                         --gas 200000 
```

If the Aspect functions correctly, the transaction will revert for odd numbers and proceed for even ones.

## Summary
