# Cosmos gRPC

Artela provides gRPC endpoints for every integrated module within the Cosmos SDK. This simplifies the interaction process for wallets and blockchain explorers, enabling them to engage with Proof-of-Stake mechanisms, as well as native Cosmos transactions and queries, more conveniently.


[Cosmos Tool](https://v1.cosmos.network/rpc/v0.45.1) is also applicable to Artela.
