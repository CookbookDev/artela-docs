# Accessing Testnet

**Option 1: Connect to Artela Testnet via RPC**

You can access the JSON-RPC port service through these URLs:

    https://testnet-rpc1.artela.network
    https://testnet-rpc2.artela.network
    https://testnet-rpc3.artela.network
    https://testnet-rpc4.artela.network

**Option 2: Establish Your Own Local Private Testnet**

For detailed steps, see [Run a Local Node](develop/node/testnet-setup).

Once you've initiated the node, connect to the JSON-RPC port service here:

    http://127.0.0.1:8545
