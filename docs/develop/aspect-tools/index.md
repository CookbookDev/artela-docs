# Aspect Tools

Artela has developed a command-line tool `aspect-tool` to streamline the development of Aspects and smart contracts. 

`aspect-tool` provides scripts for rapid building, deploying, and invoking of Aspects and smart contracts. `aspect-tool` plays a crucial role in simplifying the development of feature-rich decentralized applications (dApps) by facilitating full composability between Aspects and smart contracts.
