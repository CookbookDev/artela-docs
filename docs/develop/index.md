# Artela Devnet
Welcome to Artela playground!
Looking to build a dApp on Artela Devnet? 
Follow this guide to learn how to access Artela Devnet, build an Aspect, deploy and bind it to a smart contract.


## Why develop dApps on Artela?

## Artela Devnet Overview

Artela Devnet is an alpha version for developers. We have built the following: 

- `artelad`, the validator node which only supported running standalone in the Devnet stage.
- `ArtEVM`, the enhanced evm. It will provide runtime information for Aspect, such as the whole call stack of transactions and all contractsâ€™ state changes.
- `asolc`, the fork version of `solc`. It injects additional instructions into bytecodes, allowing smart contracts to be traced by `ArtEVM`.
- `ArtWASM`, the WASM runtime for Aspect.
- `Aspect-tool`,  the tool to develop, compile and deploy Aspect.

By Artela Devnet, you can 

- Explore what is Aspect Programming by code
- Implement some interesting ideas for Aspect Programming
- Develop proof of concept for your project
- Research how Aspect can enhance DeFi, NFT, Full-chain Game, and so on
- Collaborate with the core team to build killer use cases
- Contribute to Artela
