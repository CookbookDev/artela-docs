# Welcome to Artela Testnet

Dive into the Artela Testnet playground â€“ your entrypoint to build dApps on Artela Testnet. This guide offers insights on accessing the Artela Testnet, crafting an Aspect, and seamlessly deploying and binding it to a smart contract.

## Artela's Vision

In short, Artela allows project teams to easily build secure dApps that are customized to their needs, and yet composable with other applications. In the realm of Defi, Artela offers a universal and more powerful framework for applications to extend their functionalities through the addition of hooks. While Uni v4 hooks are application-specific (ie. Only for Uniswap), Artela supports chain-native level hook design that is cheaper, computationally more powerful, provides runtime context access, and supports the major programming languages, allowing the flourishing of hooks that can be created by anyone and attached to any application.

## An Insight into Artela Testnet

The Artela Testnet, currently in its alpha phase, is tailored for developers. Key components include:

- `artelad`: The Artela blockchain node program.
- `art-evm`: An augmented EVM, equipped to provide comprehensive runtime information for Aspect, encompassing transaction call stacks and contract state modifications.
- `asolc`: A modified version of `solc`, embedded with supplementary instructions within bytecodes, enabling smart contract tracing by `art-evm`.
- `art-wasm`: The WASM runtime dedicated for Aspect.
- `aspect-tool`: A dedicated utility for Aspect development, compilation, and deployment.

Engaging with the Artela Testnet allows you to:

- Grasp the nuances of Aspect Programming through hands-on coding.
- Ideate and implement innovative concepts within Aspect Programming.
- Develop a proof-of-concept for your initiatives.
- Analyze the transformative capabilities of Aspect in realms like DeFi, NFT, Full-chain Gaming, and more.
- Collaborate directly with the core team to pioneer breakthrough use-cases.
- Contribute to the growth and evolution of Artela.
