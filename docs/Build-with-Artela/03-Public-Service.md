# Public Service

## 1. Introduction

> **At Artela Network, Public Service is an aspect provides a universal service that can be integrated into any dApp. Thus, aspects can be used to build blockchain public infrastructures.**

When developers build their own dApps, they can choose to integrate other public aspects to reduce their development costs and improve development efficiency. For example, integrating the Automation Aspect enables protocol automation, integrating the Security Aspect improves fund security, and integrating the AML Aspect quickly meets compliance requirements.

Public Service is a technological implementation of modular design, and Artela provides an economic incentive model for Public Service developers. As more and more excellent public service components are developed, both developers and the community will benefit from it.

The operating principle of Public Service on the Artela Network is shown in the diagram:

## 2. Use Case

Among many Defi protocols, it is common for users to stake governance tokens to earn profits and share the profits with DAOs. As Smart Contracts do not have the ability to execute on a schedule, users who want to maximize their profits need to deploy off-chain services to trigger Smart Contracts for re-staking of staking rewards. Deploying services outside of the chain in this way will bring additional security issues and also lose real-time performance.

Developers can use Aspect to build native Smart Contract timers within Artela Network, for example, a daily schedule at 12:00 to implement a compound staking profit aggregator. Artela Network ensures the security of public services, and because it is based on on-chain native functionality, it is more accurate and real-time compared to off-chain services.

This model of building common shared services is called Public Service in Artela Network, as shown below:
