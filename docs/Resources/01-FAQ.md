## Q: What distinguishes Artela from the others?

Artela has enabled the borderless extensibility of the blockchain network while achieving scalability. That is to say, Artela is not only capable of meeting the demands of large-scale applications in terms of performance. DApps with intricate complexity can also be customized in an agile, modular, and native manner in Artela.

## Q: Why Artela?

1. Artela enables developers to achieve app-chain scale customization by building aspects on par with the difficulty of compiling smart contracts while maintaining native-level composability.
2. On Artela, developers can easily reuse and combine aspects, which in turn facilitates the construction of dApps with improved extensibility and maintainability through the use of modular design and the idea of SOC(Separate of Concerns).
3. By leveraging the capabilities of aspects, services such as automation and on-chain risk management can be implemented on Artela with greater security, enhanced functionality, unprecedented precision for customization, and native composability.

## Q: Whatâ€™s the main difference between Smart Contracts and Aspects?

Both smart contracts and aspects serve as programmable building units for developers to write code and develop dApps. They are different in the following ways:

1. Artela advocates the dApp-building concept of SOC (Separate of Concerns), which entails utilizing smart contracts to implement business logic and aspects to achieve additional features like risk management, security, and automation, ultimately enabling modular construction and assembly of dApps.

1. [Smart](http://2.Smart) contracts in Artela utilize EVM as the execution environment, while aspects run in WASM or other heterogeneous environments.

1. Aspects can be implemented and worked at several major joint points of the consensus process.

## Q: How to ensure the security of aspects?

 Built-in Aspects operate within a deterministic sandbox environment that leverages WASM technology, thereby guaranteeing the reliability of their execution. Due to their integration with the network validators, these aspects become an integral part of the consensus process and inherit the same level of security as the Artela main net.

Heterogeneous aspects leverage shared-security solutions to seamlessly integrate complex off-chain computing solutions, such as artificial intelligence, with on-chain activities.

## Q: How does Artela maintain high performance and scalability?

Artela utilizes parallel computing techniques to support vertical scaling, allowing for the efficient division and parallel execution of transaction groups within a block.
