# Introduction

Aspect Programming is a specific programming model that supports the dynamic creation of native extension modules for blockchain at runtime.

Aspect Programming provides a universal stack for all chains, including Layer 2 solutions, to develop native extensions at the base layers, enabling modular dApp building and customized functionality.

**Smart Contract + Native Extension = Rich dApp**

In Artela, we define a new programmable module to work as the native extension of the base layer as Aspect. Aspect integrates customized functionality into the blockchain base layer, working synergistically with smart contracts to enhance dApp modularity and functionality. 

The name “Aspect” is inspired by Aspect-oriented Programming. Aspect can tap into the complete API set of the base layer, and inject extended logic into specific join points throughout a transaction's lifecycle.

**Benefits of Aspect Programming:**

- **With Aspect, developers don‘t really need to rebuild an appchain from scratch to achieve customization for their dApps.** They can freely and easily develop Aspect to seamlessly incorporate additional native functionalities, making the process as simple and secure as deploying smart contracts.

- **Aspect can be deployed throughout the entire life cycle of transactions, with more context of transactions accessible than the smart contract. Also, the WASM virtual machine will serve as the execution environment for built-in Aspects.** The combination of these two features enables developers to explore new possibilities for on-chain functionalities. Some previously unimaginable scenarios would become within reach, like on-chain runtime protection for smart contracts, on-chain automation (eg. Just in Time MEV for dApps) with an unprecedented level of customization, effective rollup proof verification, lightweight implementation of “EIP”, and much more. Developers can harness the power of their preferred programming languages within Aspect’s secure and flexible framework, unlocking their unlimited creative potential and driving continuous value creation for the ecosystem.

- **Aspect would enable modular dApp building patterns for developers.** DApps would no longer be a collection of tightly coupled codebases. Developers can obtain promising improvements in flexibility, resilience, scalability, extensibility, and maintenance simply by assembling Aspects.
