# Overview

Aspect Programming is a universal programming framework that supports the dynamic creation of native extension modules for blockchain at runtime.

Aspect Programming provides a universal stack for all chains, including Layer 2 solutions, to develop native extensions at the base layers, enabling modular dApp building and customized functionality.

## Solution of Aspect Programming:

**Smart Contract + Native Extension = Rich dApp**

### Native Extension

Native Extension serves as a programmable on-chain module for customized functionality. It extends from the base layer and works synergistically with blockchain smart contracts, allowing dApp to be built in a plug-and-play modular manner.

Native Extension is the solution for blockchain customized functionality.

### Aspect

In Artela, we define a new programmable module to work as the native extension of the base layer as Aspect. Aspect integrates customized functionality into the blockchain base layer, working synergistically with smart contracts to enhance dApp modularity and functionality.
