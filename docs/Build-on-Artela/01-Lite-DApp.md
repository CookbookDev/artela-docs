# Lite dApp

## Introduction

> **Lite dApp is smart contracts built in the same way as before.**

There is no difference between Lite dApp and dApps running on traditional EVM architecture blockchain. Artela is compatible with EVM and seamlessly integrates with based infrastructures such as ChainLink and TheGraph. The experience of developing and deploying Lite dApps on Artela Network is the same as developing dApps on Ethereum and its Layer 2.

Aspect, as a modular extension component for sustainable integration, does not require developers to use it when building dApps. Developers can achieve equivalent capabilities of dApps built without Aspect and existing EVM architecture.

The principle of Lite dApp on Artela Network is shown in the figure below:

## Use Case

1. Smart Contracts PaaS
    
    Artela Network integrates smart contract tools as built-in options to make smart contract development as easy as possible. Artela provides Platform as a Service (PaaS) to help developers build smart contracts.

2. Smart Contracts with elastic block space need
    
    For DeFi smart contracts with a demand for high scalability, elastic block space can be leveraged to enable limitless scalability.
