## Q: What distinguishes Artela from the others?

Artela has enabled the borderless extensibility of the blockchain network while achieving scalability. That is to say, Artela is not only capable of meeting the demands of large-scale applications in terms of performance. DApps with intricate complexity can also be customized in an agile, modular, and native manner in Artela.

## Q: Why Artela?

1. Artela enables developers to achieve app-chain scale customization by building aspects on par with the difficulty of compiling smart contracts while maintaining native-level composability.
2. On Artela, developers can easily reuse and combine aspects, which in turn facilitates the construction of dApps with improved extensibility and maintainability through the use of modular design and the idea of SOC(Separate of Concerns).
3. By leveraging the capabilities of aspects, services such as automation and on-chain risk management can be implemented on Artela with greater security, enhanced functionality, unprecedented precision for customization, and native composability.

## Q: How Aspect Programming benefits dApps?

1. With Aspect, developers don‘t really need to rebuild an appchain from scratch to achieve customization for their dApps. They can freely and easily develop Aspect to seamlessly incorporate additional native functionalities, making the process as simple and secure as deploying smart contracts.
2. Aspect can be deployed throughout the entire life cycle of transactions, with more context of transactions accessible than the smart contract. Also, the WASM virtual machine will serve as the execution environment for built-in Aspects. The combination of these two features enables developers to explore new possibilities for on-chain functionalities. Some previously unimaginable scenarios would become within reach, like on-chain runtime protection for smart contracts, on-chain automation (eg. Just in Time MEV for dApps) with an unprecedented level of customization, effective rollup proof verification, lightweight implementation of “EIP”, and much more. Developers can harness the power of their preferred programming languages within Aspect’s secure and flexible framework, unlocking their unlimited creative potential and driving continuous value creation for the ecosystem.
3. Aspect would enable modular dApp building patterns for developers. DApps would no longer be a collection of tightly coupled codebases. Developers can obtain promising improvements in flexibility, resilience, scalability, extensibility, and maintenance simply by assembling Aspects.

## Q: What’s the main difference between smart contracts and Aspects?

Both smart contracts and aspects serve as programmable building units for developers to write code and develop dApps. They are different in the following ways:

1. Artela advocates the dApp-building concept of SOC (Separate of Concerns), which entails utilizing smart contracts to implement business logic and aspects to achieve additional features like risk management, security, and automation, ultimately enabling modular construction and assembly of dApps.

2. Smart contracts in Artela utilize EVM as the execution environment, while aspects run in WASM or other heterogeneous environments.

3. Aspects can be implemented and worked at several major joint points of the consensus process.

## Q: How to ensure the security of aspects?

 Built-in Aspects operate within a deterministic sandbox environment that leverages WASM technology, thereby guaranteeing the reliability of their execution. Due to their integration with the network validators, these aspects become an integral part of the consensus process and inherit the same level of security as the Artela main net.

Heterogeneous aspects leverage shared-security solutions to seamlessly integrate complex off-chain computing solutions, such as artificial intelligence, with on-chain activities.

## Q: How does Artela maintain high performance and scalability?

Artela utilizes parallel computing techniques to support vertical scaling, allowing for the efficient division and parallel execution of transaction groups within a block.
