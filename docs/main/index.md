<!-- Artela is an extensible blockchain network enabling developers to build feature-rich dApps.  -->

Artela is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of dApp functionality beyond smart contracts, unlocking the full potential of Web3 innovations.

## What Artela is building:

### Artela Blockchain
    
Artela Blockchain is a layer 1 network that empowers developers to add user-defined native extensions and build feature-rich dApps. It offers extensibility that goes beyond EVM-equivalence, inter-domain interoperability, and boundless scalability with its elastic block space design.
